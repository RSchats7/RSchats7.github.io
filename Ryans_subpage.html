                <h3>1st Pick</h3>
                    <p>Deadcells is my first pick. The reason I picked this title is its fun combat, enjoyable story and replay ablilty! Events that happen in your previous life can affect dialog and other things. There are hundreds of collectables and weapons to use and unlock in each run.</p>

                <h3>2nd pick</h3>
                <p>Hades is my second pick. I love the artstyle and the dialog really gets you invested in the setting. I love the way they depict the greek gods. The voice acting is also top notch and gets you invested. The second game Hades 2 which is still in development is coded entirly in Lua which is just a fun fact. </p>

                <h3>3rd pick</h3>
                <p>Ultrakill is a faced-pace first person shooter that takes heavy insperation from older doom titles. The music is intense and helps the vibe of traveling the levels of hell. The game has also unique gameplay mechanics like being able to punch bullets back at opponents or being able to deflect bullets off a flicked coin</p>
